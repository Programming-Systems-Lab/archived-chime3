/**
 * Pseudo-RTTI, to avoid using "normal" rtti which is a noticeable yet
 * unneeded size overhead. We need rtti only for a few objects and a limited
 * set of functions only. Because of this we provide a fake RTTI system that
 * does everything we need; it is suggested to compile the engine without
 * RTTI to create smaller executables.<p>
 * The most noticeable limitation is that it does not support multiple
 * inheritance for objects with fake RTTI. You still can derive classes from
 * multiple parents, but you should take care to not derive a class from more
 * than one class that inherits from csObject.

/**
 * A class that represents the dynamic type of an object.
 * Under the pseudo RTTI system, this class represents the type of
 * an object, which can be retrieved via the Type field or GetType() call.
 * The csIdType is designed to occupy minimal possible storage as there
 * can be lots of RTTI objects (for example, thousands of polygons).
 * In fact, the overhead of our RTTI is just the size of one method entry
 * in each object's vtable plus size of one csIdType object (two pointers)
 * for each existing RTTI class.
