/*
 * Plugins have an additional characteristic called "functionality ID".
 * This identifier is used by other plugins/engine/system driver to
 * find some plugin that user assigned to perform some function.
 * For example, the "VideoDriver" functionality identifier is used to
 * separate the main 3D graphics driver from other possibly loaded
 * driver that also implements the iGraphics3D interface (it could be
 * the secondary video driver for example).
 *<p>
 * The functionality ID is given in the system config file as left
 * side of assignment in "PlugIns" section. For example, in the
 * following line:
 * <pre>
 * [PlugIns]
 * VideoDriver = crystal.graphics3d.software
 * </pre>
 * "VideoDriver" is functionality identifier, and "crystal.graphics3d.software"
 * is SCF class ID. No two plugins can have same functionality ID. When you
 * load a plugin with System::RequestPlugin() you can define functionality ID
 * after a double colon:
 * <pre>
 * System->RequestPlugin ("crystalspace.kernel.vfs:VFS");
 * </pre>
 * If you load a plugin via the ::LoadPlugIn method you just specify the
 * functionality ID as one of arguments.
