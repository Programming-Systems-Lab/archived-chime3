 *    parameter.  This will read the necessary data for the randomizer.  It
 *    will fill the NumAreaTemplates and AreaTemplateNames fields of the
 *    statistics.  Calling this function more than once will overwrite the old
 *    data.
 * <li>3. Call CreateWorld.  This will run the randomizer and create the world, as
 *    well as fill the remaining fields of the statistics.  You can run it
 *    again if you don't like the result.
 * <li>4. Call WriteWorld to save the generated world in CS map file format.  This
 *    will first clear the precalculated stuff (optionally), then write the
 *    map text file into the given virtual directory and finally copy the
 *    textures (optionally).
