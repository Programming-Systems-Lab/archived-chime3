 * This interface is the common parent for iConfigXXXXIterator classes.
 * The iterator is used to navigate amongst a specific subclass of data
 * items from a configuration file. Such objects are created by the
 * respective method from the iConfigFile interface, and then you query
 * from it all the information you are interested. When you are finished
 * with it, you DecRef the object as usual to destroy it.
 *<p>
 * Initially the iterator does not point to anything; you should call
 * some operator method before you access the data fields. Usage example:
 *<pre>
 * iConfigSectionIterator *s = inifile->EnumSections ();
 * while (s && s->Next ())
 *   printf ("Section: [%s]\n", s->GetSection ());
 * s->DecRef ();
