 * that Crystal Space supports:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Static light. This is a normal static light that cannot move
 *     and cannot change intensity/color. All lighting information from
 *     all static lights is collected in one static lightmap.
 * <li>Pseudo-dynamic light. This is a static light that still cannot
 *     move but the intensity/color can change. The shadow information
 *     from every pseudo-dynamic light is kept in a seperate shadow-map.
 *     Shadowing is very accurate with pseudo-dynamic lights since they
 *     use the same algorithm as static lights.
 * <li>Dynamic light. This is a light that can move and change
 *     intensity/color. These lights are the most flexible. All lighting
 *     information from all dynamic lights is collected in one dynamic
 *     lightmap (seperate from the pseudo-dynamic shadow-maps).
 *     Shadows for dynamic lights will be less accurate because things
 *     will not cast accurate shadows (due to computation speed limitations).
 * </ul>
 * Note that static and pseudo-dynamic lights are represented by the
 * same csStatLight class.
