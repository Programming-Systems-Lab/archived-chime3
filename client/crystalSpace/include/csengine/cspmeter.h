/**
 * The csProgressMeter class displays a simple percentage-style textual
 * progress meter.  By default, the meter is presented to the user by passing
 * MSG_INITIALIZATION to the system print function.  This setting may be
 * changed with the SetMessageType() method.  After constructing a progress
 * meter, call SetTotal() to set the total number of steps represented by the
 * meter.  The default is 100.  To animate the meter, call the Step() method
 * each time a unit of work has been completed.  At most Step() should be
 * called 'total' times.  Calling Step() more times than this will not break
 * anything, but if you do so, then the meter will not accurately reflect the
 * progress being made.  Calling Reset() will reset the meter to zero, but
 * will not update the display.  Reset() is provided so that the meter can be
 * re-used, but it is the client's responsibility to ensure that the display
 * is in a meaningful state.  For instance, the client should probably ensure
 * that a newline '\n' has been printed before re-using a meter which has been
 * reset.  The complementary method Restart() both resets the meter and prints
 * the initial tick mark ("0%").  The meter does not print a newline after
 * 100% has been reached, on the assumption that the client may wish to print
 * some text on the same line on which the meter appeared.  If the client
 * needs a newline printed after 100% has been reached, then it is the
 * client's responsibility to print it.
