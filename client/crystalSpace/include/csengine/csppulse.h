/**
 * The csProgressPulse class provides a simple twirling textual cursor built
 * out of the characters '-', '\', '|', and '/'.  This type of functionality
 * is generally used as a sort of pulse beat during indeterminately lengthy
 * computational operations in order to let the user know that progress is
 * being made and that the program is not hanging.  By default, the pulse beat
 * is presented to the user by passing MSG_INITIALIZATION to the system print
 * function.  This setting may be changed with the SetMessageType() method.
 * To animate the pulse object, call the Step() method each time a unit of
 * work has been completed.  At each step a backspace (\b) followed by one of
 * the pulse characters (-, \, |, or /) is printed, except for the very first
 * step, in which case the backspace is omitted.  Erase() clears the pulse, if
 * necessary, by printing a backspace, followed by a space (' '), followed by
 * one more backspace.  Reset() erases the pulse and then resets the state.
 * Erase() is called automatically by the destructor.
